## How it works

Uses binary gates to add two binary digits, with a carry in bit. Outputs the sum, as well as a carry out.

## How to test

Attach inputs (buttons) to the input A, input B and carry in, and LEDs to out and Cout. Try A, B, and Cin one at a time and make 
sure only the LED on Out is on. Then try a combination of every two, and make sure just the Cout light is on. Finally, try all 
three and make sure both LEDs turn on.
